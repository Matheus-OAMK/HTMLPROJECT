# HTMLPROJECT

This project is created by Matheus Oliveira, Iurii Gaitrov and Hakan Asmaoglu.
This is a first year project for our HTML and CSS course, it includes a non functional website and a figma design.
This project consist of 3 views of an e-commerce shop. The product list page, product detail page and the checkout page.

# NOTE

The only product with a different view is "Swan Necklace". Click on it to go to the product detail page.
You can click on the shopping bag on the top right to see the checkout page.

Additionally you can click on "Necklaces" or on the "Title" to go back to the product list view.
Or on the checkout page you can click on the swan image or the product title "Dancing Swan Necklace" to go back to the product description view.

One more thing for Mac users and others, who is using Safari as main browser, third page (Shopping bag) includes the bug with "Voucher code" placeholder. All tests were running in Google Chrome and Firefox browsers only and we could not notice that bug before. Suggest you to run these web-pages in Google Chrome and Firefox browsers.
